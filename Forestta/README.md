# React + Vite

This template provides a set up on anyone looking for a hotel or restaurant website.
Regular updates will happen for the project. The project tries as much as possible to utilise most of the react dev tools.
Feel free to reach out anytime.
I'd love to collaborate with anyone.
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
